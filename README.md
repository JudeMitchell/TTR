# Ticket to Ride

A simple text adventure game in Python inspired by the board game [Ticket to Ride](http://www.daysofwonder.com/tickettoride/en/usa/).

Initial version is for two players only, with one computer player who will make the most basic of decisions and likely lose every game.

### Uh, isn't this already an online game?

It sure is! But I wanted to improve my Python development by trying to recreate the idea in Python.
